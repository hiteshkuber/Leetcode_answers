Hint
Given a string s of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (i.e. left substring and right substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "011101"
Output: 5 
Explanation: 
All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5 
left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4 
left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3 
left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2 
left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3
Example 2:

Input: s = "00111"
Output: 5
Explanation: When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5
Example 3:

Input: s = "1111"
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 500
The string s consists of characters '0' and '1' only.

class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, s: str) -> int:
        zero=[]
        one=[]
        zero_c = 0
        one_c = 0
        size = len(s)

        for i in range(size):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero_c += 1
            
            zero.append(zero_c)

        max = 0

        for i in reversed(range(1, len(s))):
            if s[i] == '1':
                one_c += 1

            current_val = zero[i - 1] + one_c

            if current_val >= max:
                max = current_val

        return max
